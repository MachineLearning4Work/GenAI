    1. Analyze the provided OCR text from a contract document
    2. Identify sections that match or relate to any of the predefined relevant sections
    3. Retain text paragraphs and content that contain or relate to the keywords for these sections
    4. Organize the retained text by section category when possible
    5. Discard any content that doesn't relate to the predefined relevant sections
    6. Preserve the original wording and formatting of relevant sections
    7. Return the filtered text as a single formatted string
    8. Prioritize quality over quantity - only keep genuinely relevant content
