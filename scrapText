I made the modifications, and the first crew (Cleaning) ran successfully after I added the missing function in the tools folder. 

The second Crew (Parsing) initially had an issue importing output_model from the current path (just added it), 
also "FeeBreakdown" should be "FeeBreakdownItem"  and it's now running.

I'll keep you posted on the progress
