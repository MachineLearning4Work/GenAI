As you can see here, I'm trying to implement a caching tool that might be useful for our project, specifically for caching data in different projects like scenario planning. However, it's not working as I expected. Based on my understanding of caching tools, we should have two functions: one to perform the actual job (in my case, add_numbers) and another function to manage the cache algorithm, which I've named cache_func(). In cache_func(), if the remainder of the input is odd, caching should be triggered, and the result should be retrieved directly from the cache without calling the main function again. To verify this, I've included sleep(10) in the add_numbers function to ensure that if the result is returned quickly, it's coming from the cache and not from re-executing the function. Despite this setup, it's not working as intended.






ou’re testing a contract parsing pipeline that processes both Word and PDF files. You’ve noticed two issues:

Tracked Changes in Word Files:

When Word documents with "tracked changes" (e.g., "shall [develop/implement]") are converted to PDF, both the original and edited text appear.

This could mislead the parser into extracting conflicting terms (e.g., "shall develop" vs. "shall implement").

Strikethrough in PDFs:

Some PDFs show strikethrough text (e.g., from tracked changes), but your parser ignores it (e.g., in page19.txt).

Good news: The strikethrough isn’t harming the parsed output, but you want to confirm best practices.

You ask: How should you handle these issues?
