Hi,
 I’ve reviewed it, but I’m currently a bit tied up with my day job. I’ll get back to you in the coming days or sooner if possible.

To put it simply, I can't suggest just one method, as this is a real-world case. 
As data scientists, we need to explore different approaches and always consider alternative solutions.

I’ll share some ideas with you soon.
